# Persistence of Vision
The term persistence of vision has come to be seen as inadequate to fully describe this very complex physiological reality; it remains a standard expression, and, as such, it serves as a useful metaphor.
Persistence of vision, as it is called, essentially prevents the world from becoming completely dark every time we blink. When light hits the retina, it leaves an impression on the brain that lasts for roughly 16–15 s after the light source is obscured from view. It is the result of an extended chemical process. Because of this, changes in light that happen faster than this retention period are not easily distinguished by the eye.
The LED Globe project achieves the phenomenon of persistence of vision by combining light-emitting diodes with a brushless motor and high velocity. According to the hypothesis of persistence of vision, an image can be seen by humans if it remains on the retina for about 1/16th of a second after it has been withdrawn.
To display the LEDs mounted on the ring, this project employs a manufactured ring that is fastened to the motor and a stable structure. The code that is delivered to the microcontroller, which then sends data to drive and control the LEDs, creates the globe image.
Microcontrollers, brushless motors, and lighting-emitting diodes are index terms.
